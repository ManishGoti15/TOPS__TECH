        Further development under the auspices of the <b><i>IETF</i></b>was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from <a href="">commercial software vendors</a> , by the <ins> World Wide Web(WWW)</ins> Consortium (W3C). <a href=""><sup>[13]</sup></a> However, in 2000, HTML also became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the <code> Web </code> Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[14]
